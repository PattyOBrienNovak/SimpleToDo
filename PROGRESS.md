# Project Progress: AI-Powered To-Do List

## Accomplishments
1. Created a functional to-do list application
2. Implemented adding, toggling, and deleting tasks
3. Styled the application with a hero section and task list
4. Moved the "Add Task" functionality to the hero section
5. Removed unnecessary navigation headers
6. Adjusted text formatting in the hero section
7. Added proper TypeScript type definitions to resolve warnings

##10-10-24:

1. Integrated OpenAI API to generate tasks based on user-defined goals
2. Created a modal component for goal input and task generation
3. Implemented server-side API route for secure OpenAI API calls
4. Updated main page to incorporate the new AI-powered feature
5. Refined UI elements, including font sizes and button styling
6. Ensured proper numbering and formatting of AI-generated tasks
7. Resolved various technical issues related to API integration and component rendering



## Next Steps
- Done! Add data persistence (e.g., local storage or a backend API)
- Implement task categories or priorities
- Add due dates to tasks
- Create a more responsive design for different screen sizes
- Remember to handle any errors that might occur during the API call and provide appropriate feedback to the user. 
Also, consider implementing rate limiting and error handling to manage API usage effectively.

- Consider adding a loading state or disabled button while tasks are being generated to prevent accidental double submissions.
You might want to add a confirmation dialog before replacing existing tasks, in case the user has important items they don't want to lose.
It might be helpful to add a small delay or animation when adding new tasks to make it more obvious when new content has been generated.


## Notes
 Line 13 of package.json is the openai dependency. was this: "openai": "^4.67.3", then I changed it to "openai": "^4.0.0", because Cursor was telling me to.
 The AI integration significantly enhances the app's functionality, allowing users to quickly generate task lists based on their goals. Future improvements should focus on user experience refinements and data management.
